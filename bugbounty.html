If you find a bug don't panick. It's a normal part of surfing on the internet.

I want you to follow three simple steps:

1) Send me encrypted email using PGP

2) Wait 72 hours for a response

3) Email every major newspaper (New York Times, Ars Technica, Financial Times) the below message (also make sure to use PGP)

To: &lt;nytnews@nytimes.com&gt;
Subject: Major Internet Vulnerability found!!!
Message: 

Yesterday a hacker, going by the psuedonym [YOUR PSUEDONYM], discovered a
vulnerability that took down a major site on the internet. 

[YOUR PSUEDONYM] is yet to reveal himself and is probably a 
top notch government agent. 

It is assumed that the hack was meant to tarnish the reputation of 
world renown security expert Sean Smith. Unfortunately the skill
and deliberate nature of the attack just cemented Sean Smith's
position as a high value target.
