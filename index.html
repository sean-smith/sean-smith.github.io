  <h4>Hi I'm Sean</h4>
  <p>I'm a Solution Architect at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/">AWS</a> which generally means I draw <a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wyLph6pYNaKLRe6z5GcKqg.png">goofy diagrams</a> on whiteboards and write code on <a href="http://www.github.com/sean-smith">github</a></p>
  <p>Prior to my current role, I was a software engineer at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/">AWS</a>, working on <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster">AWS ParallelCluster</a>. I joined AWS in 2017 and was the first engineer on the team who built AWS ParallelCluster.</p>
  <p>Prior to that I got my BA & MS in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs">Boston University</a>. I served as the president of <a href="http://builds.cc">BUILDS</a>, an on campus maker space and a generally awesome place. Previous places I worked include <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">Amazon</a> as an intern on the AWS Marketplace team. Before that I worked at <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenahealth</a> and before that I worked at <a href="http://www.activeprime.com/">ActivePrime</a>. Check out my <a href="SeanSmith.pdf">resume</a>, or the interesting <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I've worked on. The code I've written is all on <a href="http://www.github.com/sean-smith">github</a>.

  <p>My passions include high performance computing, <a href="flying.html">flying</a>, running and mountain climbing. Oh and <a href="books.html">reading</a>.</p>

  <p>I sometimes write down my thoughts <a href="http://blog.seanssmith.net">here</a>.</p>

  <p>If you are sufficiently impressed you can <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me.</p>

    <h4>Software</h4>
    <p>I build web apps that do cool stuff. My <a href="projects.html#bitcoinsentiment">latest project</a> was a prediction algorithm that scraped the web to find sentiment levels towards bitcoin and then predicted the price of bitcoin.</p>

    <h4>Hardware</h4>
